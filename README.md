git clone 
```

### How to use
##### Importing the package:

```python3
from src.map_biomas_api import MapBiomasAlertApi
```
##### Authenticating

credentials = {'email': 'your email',
               'password': 'your password'}

##### Quering the service
After getting your bearer token, you can use the api to query the service. 

Currently, MapBiomas offers five types of queries:

You can find the complete service documentation [here](https://plataforma.alerta.mapbiomas.org/api/documentation).

To query the service, you should use the query function of the MapBiomasAlertApi object passing your token, the query and filters as arguments.

##### Example
In the example bellow we query published alerts by date
```python3
filters = {
  "startDetectedAt": "2020-01-01",
  "endDetectedAt": "2021-12-30",
  "startPublishedAt": "2020-01-01",
  "endPublishedAt": "2021-12-30",
  "offset": 0,
  "limit": 2
}
result = MapBiomasAlertApi.query(token,
                                 MapBiomasAlertApi.PUBLISHED_ALERTS_QUERY,
                                 filters)

```

In the example bellow we query published alert by alert code
```python
filters = {
  "alertCode": "14691"
}
result = MapBiomasAlertApi.query(token,
                                 MapBiomasAlertApi.PUBLISHED_ALERT_QUERY,
                                 filters)
```
The result object of the query above should be a dictionary conatining the information about the deforastion alert
```python3
{
  "data": {
    "publishedAlert": {
      "alertCode": "14691",
      "areaHa": 1.2429,
      "sources": [
        "DETERB-AMAZONIA"
      ],
      "bbox": [
        -56.3378933695091,
        -6.0042908703269475,
        -56.320931339719536,
        -5.9873288405373835
      ],
      "alertBiomes": [
        "AMAZÔNIA"
      ],
      "alertCities": [
        "ITAITUBA"
      ],
      "alertStates": [
        "PARÁ"
      ],
      "detectedAt": "2019-06-04",
      "publishedAt": "2020-02-11",
      "deforestationClass": null
    }
  }
}
